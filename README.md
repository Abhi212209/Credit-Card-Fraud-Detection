# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

# Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can detect fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time, reducing the risk of financial losses for individuals and institutions. The goal is to create a system that can accurately identify suspicious transactions, enabling prompt action to prevent fraud.

# Key Features
# Data Collection:
A dataset of credit card transactions, including legitimate and fraudulent transactions, is collected and preprocessed for training the model.
# Model Development:
A machine learning model is developed and trained using the collected dataset to learn the patterns and relationships between transaction features and fraudulent behavior.
# Model Evaluation: 
The performance of the model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure its reliability and effectiveness.

# Technical Details
# Programming Language: 
Python
# Machine Learning Library: 
Numpy,Pandas,Scikit-learn,Logistic Regression
# Dataset: A collection of credit card transaction data from Kaggle
